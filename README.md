# Modular Legal Ontology (MLO)

MLO, a BFO-based domain ontology, is a practical solution we've developed to integrate ontologies and other resources within the legal domain. Recognizing the vastness of this domain, we've adopted a modular approach, creating small, manageable ontologies. This approach ensures the computational processability of MLO, making it an efficient tool for legal professionals, ontology developers, and researchers.
