# Modular Legal Ontology (MLO)

MLO is a BFO-based domain ontology, a practical solution we've developed to integrate ontologies and other resources within the USA legal domain. Recognizing the vastness of this domain, we've adopted a modular approach, creating small, manageable ontologies. This approach ensures MLO's computational processability, making it an efficient tool for legal professionals, ontology developers, and researchers.
